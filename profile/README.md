# Fedora image mode systemd system extensions (sysexts)

Community built systemd system extensions (sysexts) for Fedora image mode
systems and derivatives. Those sysexts should work will all Fedora based image
mode systems (Atomic Desktops, CoreOS, IoT, etc.), wether they are Bootable
Containers (bootc) images, or classic ostree/rpm-ostree systems. They should
also work with derivative images such as Bluefin, Aurora or Bazzite from the
Universal Blue project.
